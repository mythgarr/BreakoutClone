# BreakoutClone
A simple HTML5+javascript breakout clone with the goal of being easy to read, modify and remix. Features are intentionally missing to encourage independent experimentation.

# Instructions
[Download](https://github.com/mythgarr/BreakoutClone/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract to your computer, then open game.html in any modern browser.
Edit script.js and refresh your browser to test changes.

# Ideas for improvement
* Change the number of rows and columns
* Change the size of each brick
* Make the paddle narrower/wider
* Modify the point values for each row of bricks
* Modify the color for each row of bricks
* Add multiple levels
* Use your imagination - the sky is the limit!
